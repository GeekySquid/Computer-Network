Let's dive into Module I, which forms the foundation of Computer Networks. This module covers the basic architecture of networks (Reference Models) and the physical hardware used to transmit data (Physical Layer).

Module I: Overview of the Internet & Physical Layer based on your syllabus.

1. Reference Models: OSI vs. TCP/IP
This is the most critical theoretical concept in this module. You need to understand how networks are layered to manage complexity.

The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection): This is a 7-layer conceptual model used to standardize communication. You must know the function of each layer:

Physical Layer: Transmits raw bits over a medium.

Data Link Layer: Handles error detection and framing.

Network Layer: Handles routing and logical addressing (IP).

Transport Layer: Ensures reliable process-to-process delivery (TCP/UDP).

Session Layer: Manages sessions between applications.

Presentation Layer: Translates data (encryption, compression).

Application Layer: User interface services (HTTP, FTP).

The TCP/IP Model: This is the practical model used in the real-world Internet. It condenses the OSI layers into 4 or 5 layers (Application, Transport, Internet, Link/Physical).

Comparison: You will often be asked to compare these two. The key difference is that OSI is a theoretical reference model, while TCP/IP is the actual implementation used today.

2. Physical Layer: Data & Signals
The Physical Layer deals with moving raw bits (0s and 1s) from one device to another.

Analog vs. Digital Signals:

Analog Signals: Continuous waves (like human voice or old radio).


Digital Signals: Discrete pulses (0s and 1s), which computers use.


Periodic Analog Signals: Signals that repeat a pattern over time (Sine waves).

Transmission Impairments: Signals don't travel perfectly forever. You need to know what damages them:

Attenuation: Loss of energy (signal gets weaker).

Distortion: Change in the signal's shape.

Noise: Unwanted outside signals interfering with the data.


Data Rate Limit: This refers to the maximum speed data can be transmitted (Bandwidth vs. Throughput).

3. Transmission Media
This section covers how the data physically travels.


Guided Media (Wired): The signal is contained within a physical cable.

Twisted Pair: Used in Ethernet cables (LANs).

Coaxial Cable: Used in cable TV and early internet.

Fiber Optics: Uses light; highest speed and security.


Unguided Media (Wireless): The signal travels through the air.

Radio Waves: Omni-directional (Wi-Fi).

Microwaves: Uni-directional (Satellite links).

Infrared: Short-range (TV remotes).

Important Questions to Prepare for Module I
Explain the OSI Reference Model: Draw the 7 layers and briefly explain the function of each.

OSI vs. TCP/IP: Create a comparison table showing the differences and similarities between the two models.

Transmission Impairments: What are Attenuation, Distortion, and Noise? How do they affect data transmission?

Guided vs. Unguided Media: Compare Twisted Pair cable with Fiber Optic cable. When would you use one over the other?
